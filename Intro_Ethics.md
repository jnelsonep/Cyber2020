# Introduction & Ethics

## Overview
Cyber Security is an increasingly in-demand field of Computer Science. In this course we will look at the major ideas in the fields of Cyber Security or Information Assurance. This is not a "hacking" class but we are looking at the ways that computers, programs, networks, and people are exploited by hackers and what we can do to prevent or minimize the damage caused by bad actors.


## Purpose
This activity will give students an opportunity to learn about a major hacking event in-depth and share with the class. This also serves as a way to get students in the class to speak and contribute to the discussion.  

As a class looking at how computers are exploited, we will be learning a lot of skills that could be used to access someone's computer or network without their permission.  While all of these skills are easily learned on the Internet, it is important that we agree to respect private property and never access something without permission.


### Objectives
#### Students will be able to:
- Discuss ethical behavior in online context
- Ethical dilemma, gray areas
- Identify Ten Commandments of Cyber Ethics
- Describe a major hacking event
- Identify the vulnerability that led to the attacks
- Suggest ways to prevent similar attacks
