### Activity
In pairs, research one of the major hacking events of the past several years.
In your research, identify several important ideas:
- Who was attacked?
- Who was the attacker (or who is thought to be if unclear)?
- What was the motive (money, political, warfare, prank)
- What was the result of the attack?
- How can this type of attack be prevented in the future?

Compile this information into a presentation for the class.

### Wrap-up
- Discussion of hacking events
- Hackers gain a detailed knowledge of a computer or system then find  vulnerabilities.  
> Thinking of your own house, could you get in if you didn't have a key?
> What inside knowledge do you have of your own home that would allow access?  
> What could you change to strengthen your home-security?
> Would the additional security be a benefit or a hindrance?  For example, 10 locks would make your door more secure but would also limit your own access in a speedy way.
